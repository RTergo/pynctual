This is a python based project which is to monitor attendance using a fingerprint reader. The attendance system should allow multiple sign-in/sign-out for a person and at the end of day (2am) should report all the statistics of persons present and number of hours present. It should also have an option for a webhook where it can send sign-in/sign-out messages to a remote http service.
